Hi!

If you made it here, then welcome! I have no idea how you managed it since I haven't really done anything as of yet besides get the domain set up here. Oh, and on Bluesky (I haven't posted anything, but you can follow me there too)!

Anyway, I'm Rob, and I'm a Research and Scholarship Librarian. I recently transitioned from working at a federal library to now working at an academic library. As such, I felt it would be a fun idea to start blogging about all the differences I've noticed going from the federal government to academia. Of course, it's my own experience - I went from being very specialized in what I did to now needing more general library skills. But it's like riding a bike, isn't it? Hopefully?

Anyway, I'm currently working on everything still, especially on this site. It utilizes Jekyll, which I haven't used before, and GitHub pages, so I'm learning as I go. So expect barebones until I figure out what's going on.

Still - welcome. I'm glad you're here and hope you will continue to follow my journey.

-Rob
